# Huffman-Coding

This was an assignment done in the Program and Data Representation course at UVA. I was responsible for writing code to build the huffman tree, encode a message using the tree, and decode a message using the tree. Note that input was read from a file and output was written to a file. 

The majority of this code was written by me, however some of the commenting and methods were given to the class by our professor.
